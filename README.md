# Legged-Robots
My Legged Robot Project at e-Yantra in Year 2022.
Inspired by Ascento Robot, we developed our own robot similar to the one in an internship program at e-Yantra. I, alongside my colleague Avijit Pandey guided three of our interns namely Ayush, Shreyas and Srujan to make the robot. We named it s Bunny Bot for its capability to hop and move in plane.
The video link of the project is given in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfmh1Xecu4k&list=PLK0jpMYIBd6BGnQJQYf43Kv_qziwwk5SU&index=15">#Hopping Robot</a>
